So, l;ooks like js for click is not working...

2 options

1. try note making using php part. and bring notes back to display using view or something..and display ...all by php

2. debug javascript (not a preferable option.)

--- also poduction needs to be merged onto master n then master to develop.....to ensure the db settings match everywhere

and we need to create correct databases locally too...for this all to work ok...




----

so only 2 more steps needed now...

- store notes
- install 2 3 versions like ava,,,and ask people who they would love to talk to to, and they can post photos...
and we make those public....so we can find out the most popular girl/boy/couple/teacher/inestor people want to tlk to


--- modelling hunt

instagram hnunt

etc etc......we find models this way too...to give them popularity ...maybe...just a thought..for fun 

---- another idea could be a quillbot alternative... where you say something and ava rephrases your words to sound better....

ava + quillbot = Hot assistant that writes your articles by herself...and even tests multiple versions of them, through whatsapp
chat insta etc...to see where you might succeed and what might succeed.....

**** main thing is....i have to show like I am also giving away free entry to ava. and i give them logins, eithe rmine or 
create more for them.....and put a price to ava, and i make it free for them......maybe even a limited offer.....

********
$$$$$$$$$$$$
Looks great!!! almost working.....perfect colors.....just need to store and give logins away....
generate logins...and give out unique ones.....which are limited in quantity 
, so people should make their own..if they like the idea and register using their 
phone and email....there will be job n business n entertainment opportunities for them if they do so..'
.otherwise we reuse the logins for someone else more willing and deserving...
